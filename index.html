    <h2 class="section__heading">Bouncing Ball</h2>

      <div class="l-content">
        <p>
         When I was 8 years old, my dad brought home our first personal computer, a Commodore64. We hooked it up to the TV and turned it on.  I turned to my dad and asked, “Where are the games?”
        </p>

        <p>
          He smiled, handed me a book and told me that if I typed what was in the book into the computer, I could make my own games. I remember wondering if this was his way of getting me to read.  After a couple of minutes of searching my dad for games, my curiosity got the better of me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The book was full of “codes” that I thought only spies could decipher with special decoder rings.  I didn’t understand how this book was going to become a game but was determined to find out. I copied the “codes” into the computer.  I made a lot of mistakes that made the computer do weird things, but after several attempts, the computer finally decoded what I had typed. I watched in amazement as a small ball bounced across my screen. It was great, and I made it…
        </p>

        
        <p>
          With a huge smile on my face, I emerged from behind the screen. I showed my mom what I’d made, she was proud (possibly because she thought I read a book), then I showed my dad. He smiled and then asked,  “Can you make the ball a different colour?” I paused… turned around, went back to the computer and opened my book again.
